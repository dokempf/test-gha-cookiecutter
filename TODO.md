This TODO list is automatically generated from the cookiecutter-cpp-project template.
The following tasks need to be done to get a fully working project:


* Push to your remote repository for the first time by doing `git push origin main`.
* Make sure that the following software is installed on your computer:
  * A C++-14-compliant C++ compiler
  * CMake `>= 3.9`
  * The testing framework [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2)
* Make sure that CI/CD pipelines are enabled in your Gitlab project settings and that
  there is a suitable Runner available. If you are using the cloud-hosted gitlab.com,
  this should already be taken care of.
* Enable the integration of Readthedocs with your Git hoster. In the case of Github, this means
  that you need to login at [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org) and click the button
  *Import a Project*.
* Make sure that doxygen is installed on your system, e.g. by doing `sudo apt install doxygen`
  on Debian or Ubuntu.
* Edit the parameters of `pyproject.toml` file to contain the necessary information
  about your project, such as your email adress, PyPI classifiers and a short project description.
* Head to your user settings at `https://pypi.org` and `https://test.pypi.org/` to setup PyPI trusted publishing.
  In order to do so, you have to head to the "Publishing" tab, scroll to the bottom
  and add a "new pending publisher". The relevant information is:
  * PyPI project name: `testghacookiecutter`
  * Owner: `dokempf`
  * Repository name: `test-gha-cookiecutter`
  * Workflow name: `pypi.yml`
  * Environment name: not required
* Enable the integration with `codecov.io` by heading to the [Codecov.io Website](https://codecov.io),
  log in (e.g. with your Github credentials) and enable integration for your repository. In order to do
  so, you need to select it from the list of repositories (potentially re-syncing with GitHub). Then, head
  to the "Settings" Tab and select "Global Upload Token". Here, you should select the "not required" option.
* Fill CITATION.cff with specific information about project. See [Citation File Format (CFF) Website](https://citation-file-format.github.io/) for more information.
