This TODO list is automatically generated from the cookiecutter-cpp-project template.
The following tasks need to be done to get a fully working project:

* Set up a remote repository. You can e.g. create a project in GitHub or GitLab and run
  the following commands in your locally generated project folder: `git remote add origin <Remote-URL>`
  For a seamless integration, the name of the project should also be `test-github-actions-cookiecutter-cpp-project`.
* Make sure that CI/CD pipelines are enabled in your Gitlab project settings and that
  there is a suitable Runner available. If you are using the cloud-hosted gitlab.com,
  this should already be taken care of.
* Enable your Travis CI integration by logging into travis-ci.org and enabling the
  relevant repository from e.g. your public Github repositories.
* Enable the integration of Readthedocs with your Git hoster. In the case of Github, this means
  that you need to login at [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org) and click the button
  *Import a Project*. Currently, it is necessary to manually switch the default branch to `main`
  under *Settings*/*Advanced Settings*/*Standard Branch*.
* Make sure that doxygen is installed on your system, e.g. by doing `sudo apt install doxygen`
  on Debian or Ubuntu.
* Edit the parameters of `setup()` in `setup.py` file to contain the necessary information
  about your project, such as your email adress, PyPI classifiers and a short project description.
* Add the secret variables `TESTPYPI_API_TOKEN` and `PYPI_API_TOKEN` to your GitHub project.
  These variables can be generated by heading to `https://test.pypi.org/` and `https://pypi.org`,
  adding a new project and generating these tokens.
